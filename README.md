Instructions
------------

Enter each name as a new line in the box. You should be able to do a big batch of participants with copying rows of one column in excel file and paste it into the text box. The first nametag will be created with the first line of Firstname, first line of Lastname, first line of Affiliation (and repeated for all lines). You don't need last name if you paste the full name in first name. It will skip if there are nothing in that line, so as long as the rows are same length from where you copy, the names and affiliation will be aligned even with missing data.
